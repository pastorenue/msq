# Learning AMQP with RabbitMQ

This project is a personal exploration of RabbitMQ and the AMQP protocol. It serves as a refresher to understand and experiment with the different types of exchanges provided by RabbitMQ.

## Various Exchanges

### Direct Exchange
Learn how to route messages to specific queues based on routing keys.

### Fanout Exchange
Explore broadcasting messages to all queues bound to the exchange.

### Topic Exchange
Experiment with routing messages based on pattern matching of routing keys.

### Headers Exchange
Understand how to route messages based on message headers instead of routing keys.

### RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
Implement request-response messaging patterns using RabbitMQ.

## Prerequisites

- RabbitMQ installed using docker or installed locally.
- Basic understanding of messaging patterns and the AMQP protocol.
- A working installation of your Python

## Getting Started
